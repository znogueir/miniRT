# 42-miniRT
#### A 42 School project
<br>

Goal(s):
- create a modest raytracer in C capable of rendering simple geometric objects, with the help of a basic graphics library.
<br>

Features :
- real time rendering of basic 3D shapes (planes, spheres, cylinders, cones(bonus))
- user inputs handling :
  - move, resize (diameter, height), rotate objects (3 axis)
  - move, rotate camera (3 axis)
  - save scene
  - hiding objects
- basic gui
- multiple light sources (spots)
- colored light sources and ambient lighting
- phong reflection model
<br>

Concept(s) learned :
- formulas of 3d shapes
- 3d vectors manipulation and calculations (rotation, scaling, normalizing, cross and dot products, [Rodrigues' formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrigues%27_rotation_formula), ...)
- phong model

-e ## Quickstart

To get started with 42-miniRT, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd 42-miniRT
   ```

2. Build the project using Make:

   ```sh
   make
   ```

3. Run the executable with your desired scene file (replace `{filename}.rt` with an actual scene file):

   ```sh
   ./miniRT {filename}.rt
   ```

Note: Make sure you have the required dependencies installed (e.g., MinilibX, libft).
